# Authentication & Video Streaming Fixes Applied

## âœ… Authentication Requirements Added

### 1. **Mandatory Sign-In**
- Users must be authenticated with Firebase before accessing rooms
- Automatic redirect to home page if not signed in
- Loading screen while checking authentication status

### 2. **Proper User Identification**
- Uses Firebase user UID as peer connection ID (instead of random UUID)
- Sends comprehensive user info to backend:
  - Firebase UID
  - Display name
  - Email
  - Avatar URL
  - User ID for peer connections

### 3. **Enhanced User Data Flow**
```javascript
// Frontend sends:
{
  type: 'join',
  id: user.uid,                    // Firebase UID for peer connections
  name: user.displayName,          // Display name
  email: user.email,               // Email address
  avatar: user.photoURL,           // Profile picture
  firebaseUid: user.uid,           // Firebase UID for backend tracking
  displayName: user.displayName    // Fallback display name
}
```

### 4. **Backend Updates**
- Now captures and logs Firebase UID for each user
- Enhanced user info storage including email and display name
- Better user tracking for Firestore integration

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Streaming Improvements

### 1. **Stable Peer Connections**
- Uses consistent Firebase UID for peer identification
- Prevents duplicate peer connections
- Better error handling and retry logic

### 2. **Enhanced Stream Handling**
- Improved video element handling
- Added stream state tracking
- Better autoplay handling for received streams

### 3. **Connection Lifecycle**
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Better WebSocket close handling
- Prevents "User-Initiated Abort" errors

## ðŸ”§ Key Benefits

1. **Consistent User Identity**: Firebase UID ensures same user has same ID across sessions
2. **Better Error Handling**: Authenticated users have proper error recovery
3. **Firestore Ready**: User data now includes all necessary fields for database storage
4. **Improved Stability**: Authentication check prevents incomplete connections

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

1. **Test Authentication**: Try accessing room without signing in - should redirect
2. **Test Sign-In Flow**: Sign in with Google, then join room
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for:
   - `âœ… User authenticated: [firebase-uid]`
   - `ðŸŽ¬ Starting room connection for authenticated user`
   - `ðŸ“¤ Sent join message with authenticated user info`
   - Backend: `ðŸ‘¤ User [name] (Firebase: [uid]) joining room`

4. **Test Video Streaming**: With two authenticated users, video should now work properly

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

- Only authenticated users can access rooms
- Video streams should work between authenticated users
- Peer connections should be more stable
- User identity is consistent across sessions
- Ready for Firestore user data storage
